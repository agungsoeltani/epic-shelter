# Rclone guides

This repo contains a number of markdown files describing a number of issues I
ran into with rclone, and how I tested them and the final outcome. I'm
documenting these with the hope that they may help someone else someday (or
myself when I forget about them).

# Format

Each file contains a description of the issue that I discovered. These also may
describe a scenario in which the issue may arise. It will describe the test that
I ran, as well as the outcome of the test. Each file will also contain a TL;DR
for those of you who just want to cut to the chase.

# Why

The why of this project I feel is pretty simple. I ran into a number of
conceptual issues with rclone during my use of it. To figure out how rclone will
handle the issue, I designed and ran a small test to see how it would work.

# Contributing

This data is in no way complete. If there are any issues you want me to test,
feel free to open an issue and let me know. You can also open a PR with your own
test data.
